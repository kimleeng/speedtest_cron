# speedtest_cron

Create a google spreadsheet (default name speedtest) with a api shared into it (instructions for google setup can be found https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html)

Then set up the homelogger_speedtest.py to run as a crontask and it'll log every time it's run into your google drive spreadsheet.
